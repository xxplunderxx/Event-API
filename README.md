# EVENTLY
Evently is a app to help people connect to others in their neighborhoods. As someone who moved to a new city
from a small town it can be difficult to find things to do with people around my age. This app is meant to help
address this issue by being a one stop shop for community events small and large.

# Event-UI
This is the backend repository that will assist the frontend in event postings
